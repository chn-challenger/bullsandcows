<h1> Rules of the game </h1>
<!-- <p>  The digits must be all different. Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches.<br>
     If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls", if in different positions, they are "cows". Example:<br>
    •	Secret number: 4271<br>
    •	Opponent's try: 1234<br>
    •	Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)<br>
    The first one to reveal the other's secret number wins the game. As the first player has a logical advantage, the game can be balanced<br>
    over multiple games by alternating the right to go first, or over a single game by granting the second player an equal number of guesses,<br>
    possibly resulting in a tie.</p><br/> -->
<p>Bulls and cows is a two player code-breaking game similar to the board game Mastermind. Players choose a secret 4 digit number, the<br>
    digits must all be different. Then, in turn, players will attempt to guess their opponent's number. If any digits guessed are in the<br>
    correct position, they are "bulls", if in a different position, they are "cows". For example:</p><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Secret number: 4271</li>
      <li>Opponent's attempt: 1234</li>
      <li>Result: 1 bull and 2 cows, the bull is "1" and cows are "4" and "1"</li>
    </ul><br>
<p>The first one to reveal the other's secret number wins the game.</p>
